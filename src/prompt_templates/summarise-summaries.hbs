This prompt ends with a set of summaries of source files in a code repo, seperated by three pipes (|||). They include a filename and a summary of the file.

Respond with a report on the functionality present in those files. Compress your output, using no unecessary language, and omitting no important details.

Inform the reader of the functionality present, the major points of interest, and other information critical to understanding the source code.

Finally, explain what the major, important symbols do, and why they are important, useful, or implemented as they are.

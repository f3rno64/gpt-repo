Here is a list of the files in this project:

```
{{#each filePaths}}

You may request file listings with the 'REQUEST_FILE' command.
You may create files with the 'CREATE_FILE' command.
You may edit files with the 'EDIT_FILE' command.
You may delete files with the 'DELETE_FILE' command.
You may query the user with the 'QUERY_USER' command.

The contents passed to both 'CREATE_FILE' and 'EDIT_FILE' must be the full contents of the file, not just changes.
